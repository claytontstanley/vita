\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Rice University, Computer Human Interaction Laboratory}{May 2012 - Aug 2012}{Research Programmer}{Houston, TX}
\item Migrated lab's Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) GUI code to Clozure Common Lisp (CCL).
  Implemented subset of the MCL GUI specification in CCL, so that CCL could compile original MCL code.
\item Heavy use of Clozure's Objective-C / Cocoa bridge, CLOS and extending Clozure's easygui class, multiple inheritance / mixins, read- and compile-time macros.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Air Force Research Laboratory, Cognitive Models and Agents}{May 2009 - May 2012}{Cognitive Scientist and Software Engineer}{Dayton, OH}
\item Successfully designed and implemented a transition path when the lab relocated from Mesa, AZ to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. 
Seamless transition of network connectivity, software, \& services.
First organization at WPAFB to certify and connect to the Defense Research Engineering Network.
\item Developer for the net-centric MindModeling volunteer computing research project.
Part of small (3 person) development team that redesigned and reimplemented the entire system between 2010-2011.
Systems-level project. 10,000+ SLOC. 10+ programming languages.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Rice University, Computer Human Interaction Laboratory}{May 2007 - May 2009}{Graduate Student}{Houston, TX}
\item Explored the mechanisms involved in producing various phenomena found in human visual search tasks
(e.g., distractor ratio effect, global effect) through modeling with the ACT-R cognitive architecture. 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{United States Air Force Academy, Department of Physics}{May 2006 - May 2007}{Research Assistant}{Colorado Springs, CO}
